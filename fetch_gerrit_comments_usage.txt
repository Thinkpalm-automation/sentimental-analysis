## User Guide: fetch_gerrit_comments.py

### Purpose
This script extracts Gerrit code review comments related to JIRA issues from a JIRA CSV export, downloads the comments from Gerrit, and consolidates them into a single JSON file for further analysis.

---

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Access to the JIRA CSV export file
- Gerrit (HTTP)credentials (username and password) **(only required if you want to fetch Gerrit data)**
- Internet access to reach the Gerrit server

---

### How to Use

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the scriptâ€™s directory:**
   
   cd C:\Users\testuser\Documents\Jira Analysis\flask_app

3. **Run the script with required arguments:**
   python fetch_gerrit_comments.py --csv <path_to_jira_csv> [--user <gerrit_username> --password <gerrit_password>]

   - Replace `<path_to_jira_csv>` with the path to your JIRA CSV file (e.g., `Jira_squad_6_weeks_data.csv`).
   - If you want to fetch Gerrit data, provide your Gerrit (HTTP) credentials with `--user` and `--password`.
   - If you do **not** provide credentials, the script will only process Jira data and create an empty Gerrit JSON structure.

   **Example (with Gerrit):**
   python fetch_gerrit_comments.py --csv Jira_squad_6_weeks_data.csv --user johndoe --password sde2e34dEFs4567BGa2d34g
   **Example (Jira only):**
   python fetch_gerrit_comments.py --csv Jira_squad_6_weeks_data.csv

---

### Flask App Integration
- In the Flask dashboard, Gerrit data is optional. If you check the "Fetch Gerrit Data" box and provide credentials, the app will fetch and analyze Gerrit comments. If you leave it unchecked, only Jira data is processed.

---

### What the Script Does

- **Extracts** all JIRA issue keys and Gerrit links from the provided CSV.
- **For each Gerrit link:**
  - Fetches the commit message and checks which JIRA issues it addresses.
  - Downloads all comments for the Gerrit change.
  - Saves each set of comments to a JSON file named `<issue_key>_<project>_<change_number>.json`.
- **Consolidates** all downloaded comments into a single file:  
  `consolidated_gerrit_comments.json`

---

### Output

- Individual JSON files for each issue/project/change (for reference).
- A single consolidated file:  
  `consolidated_gerrit_comments.json`  
  This file contains all the relevant comments and is ready for use in further analysis or dashboards.

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors:** Double-check your Gerrit username and password.
- **Network errors:** Ensure you have internet access and can reach `gerrit.eng.cohesity.com`.
- **CSV errors:** Make sure your CSV file is exported from JIRA and contains the necessary columns.
